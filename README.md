## 🚀 About Me

Backend developer by day 🌅 | Night owl coder by night 🦉 | Making tech so simple your mother could use it!

I'm passionate about building robust systems and making complex things stupidly simple. My philosophy? Look at everything through a lazy person's eyes - if it's not stupid-proof, it's not done right. No over-engineering unless it actually makes things more foolproof!

- 🔭 I'm currently working on **Insurance Engine systems**
- 🌱 I'm currently learning **Svelte & Project Management**
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on **Backend systems & AI/ML projects**
- 💬 Ask me about **Laravel, Go, NestJS, or making complex systems simple**
- 🎯 Goal: **Make systems so intuitive that anyone can use them**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **You'll find me lifting weights at the gym when I'm not coding!** 💪
- 🧠 Philosophy: **Lazy-driven development - automate everything, simplify the rest**

## 🏆 What I'm Building

### 🏢 Insurance Engine Systems
Building robust, scalable insurance processing systems that handle complex business logic while maintaining simplicity for end users.

**Focus Areas:** `Risk Assessment` `Policy Management` `Claims Processing` `API Design`

### 🤖 AI-Powered Solutions
Leveraging LangChain and AI/ML to create intelligent systems that automate complex decision-making processes.

**Tech Stack:** `Python` `LangChain` `OpenAI APIs` `Vector Databases`

### 🛠️ Developer Tools
Creating tools and utilities that make other developers' lives easier - because if I'm too lazy to do it manually, others probably are too!

**Philosophy:** `Automation First` `Stupid-Proof Design` `Minimal Configuration`

## 💡 My Development Philosophy

```typescript
const myApproach = {
  principle: "Make it so simple your mother could use it",
  methodology: "Lazy-driven development",
  rules: [
    "Automate everything that can be automated",
    "If it needs explanation, it needs simplification",
    "No over-engineering unless it makes things foolproof",
    "User experience > Developer ego"
  ],
  测试: "If a 5-year-old can't figure it out, back to the drawing board"
};
```

## 🏋️ When I'm Not Coding

**🏋️‍♂️ Gym Life:** You'll find me lifting weights and having fun at the gym - physical strength fuels mental clarity!

**🌙 Night Owl:** My most productive coding hours are when the world sleeps. There's something magical about 2 AM code sessions.

**📚 Always Learning:** Currently diving into Svelte and project management - because great code needs great leadership too.
